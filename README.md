### McDonald et al. canine microbiome study

Below are the input sequences, software used and results output
from the study. To retrieve a local copy with all folders included,
use the 'Download ZIP' button above. 

#### Input sequences

There are FASTQ formatted and zipped files in the Input_seqs 
folder, one for PCR and RT. 

#### BION software

We post here the version (0.5) that was used with the study for 
transparency reason. It is however a now outdated pre-release, 
which is inferior to the current one. BION 0.5 is licensed by 
the GNU General Public License version 3, but we discourage its 
use. The current one will soon be available at http://bionsoftware.com

#### Results 

The path to side-by-side comparison of PCR and RT species are,

* Results_PCR+RT/RDP/PCR+RT.species 
* Results_PCR+RT/RDP/PCR+RT.species.html
* Results_PCR+RT/Silva/PCR+RT.species   
* Results_PCR+RT/Silva/PCR+RT.species.html 

Similar outputs are included for sequence, genus, family, order, 
class and phylum levels. There are counts for the pre-processing 
steps, see the .stats or .stats.html files in each folder.
