   name = organism-profile-mapper
   summary = Maps similarities onto a reference organism taxonomy and creates a binary profile. Similarities can be filtered by oligo-totals (=~ sequence length), by minimum value, by top range and a weighting option controls how to treat less good matches relative to the best ones. Proper method documentation will be written and linked to here.
