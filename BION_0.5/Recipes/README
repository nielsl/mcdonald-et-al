Directory of recipes 

All files in here are overwritten during updates, so do not keep
recipes worth keeping in here. Instead, copy them to directories
very near the data they apply to, and outside the main BION
directory. 

It is practical to place the recipes very close to the data they 
apply to: then it is always clear which parameters were used on 
the data, it becomes easy to rerun a pipeline with the appropriate
settings, and the recipes will be part of data backups.
