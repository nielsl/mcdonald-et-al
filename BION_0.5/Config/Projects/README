# --------
#
# A project is a customized mixture of methods and data, with its own
# navigation menus, URL and style. Projects allow quick assembly of 
# highly dynamic customized pages fit for a special purpose, but only
# from methods and data that are known to the system. The files in 
# this directory named with all lowercase letters define projects, 
# and below is help with how to create them.
