# This file lists software and data directories, relative to the

#
# In the perl code, keys below become variables in the Common::Config 
# name space that holds fully expanded paths. For example, the 
# $Common::Config::img_dir will typically become

# which there are files needed for viewers and other software. There
# are two types: permanent and temporary. Permanent ones (accounts)
# are given to users that have registered with a user name and

# temporary ones are created when users just connect and browse and
# they go away after a while.
