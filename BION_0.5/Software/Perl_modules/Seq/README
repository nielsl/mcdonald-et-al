This directory has modules that do different types of sequence related
things. See the top of each interesting-looking module.

Basic sequence processing pipeline notes

1. Cleaning

      Poly-A removal (>= 17 A, <= 1 mismatch)
      Poly-C removal (>= 17 C, <= 1 mismatch)
      5' quality trim (window 10, quality >= 96%)
      3' quality trim (window 10, quality >= 96%)
      Length filter (length >= 16)
      Adapter prediction (tcgtatgCCGTCTtct)
      5' adapter trim (overlap >= 4)
      3' adapter trim 1 (overlap >= 1)
      3' adapter trim 2 (overlap >= 4)
      Length filter (length >= 16)
      Quality filter (quality >= 96%)

2. Clustering

      Using uclust (CD-hit 4.0 also feasible)
      No mismatches within clusters
      Internal gaps allowed, but difficult
      Essentially a data reduction step only

3. Comparison with known

      Lists possible annotations per cluster
      nsimscan used (free blast alternative)
      Agains MiRBase, Silva, fRNAdb, NCBI
      Database-specific strictness
      Weak matches generally needed 
      (Better: create motifs from alignments)

4. Profiling

      Sums cluster sizes to expression value
