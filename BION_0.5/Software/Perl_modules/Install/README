Here is supposed to be all installation routines. But not yet:

Data installation is in a bad state: because of the diversity of 
data and their different organisation and formats, at first routines were
written to for each dataset, because that was the quickest. These routines
are in {RNA,DNA,Protein}::Download and {RNA,DNA,Protein}::Import. Instead
all data install code should be in this module, and the routines should be
able to handle install directives made in the registry entry for a given
dataset. Software install works this way, but data diversity is greater.

So this is in flux.
