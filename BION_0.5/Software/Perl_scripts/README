Directory and subdirectories with scripts. To see how to use a 
script, type its name. That works for all scripts except those 
whose names begin with "start_" or "stop_".

Almost all scripts simply handle command line arguments and then
merely invoke a library function.

Scripts for starting/stopping servers, creating users, and such 
administrative tasks that all have to do with the basic system.

Install directory

Scripts for installing data and software.
