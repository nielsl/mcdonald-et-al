<h3>For sponsors</h3>
<p>
BION is a 100% open source package and it will remain that way (see
<a href="BION.about.html">about</a>). We can implement any desired 
feature, and do it efficiently. Users with money can thus get what they
need and can think about the software should be doing, instead of just 
asking what it can already do. We do custom recipes and can automate 
any popular workflow, especially if there are open source tools for 
the steps already. We work at reasonable rates, negotiate fixed prices
and send no bill until things work as agreed. We will discuss features 
with anyone without obligation and make a ballpark estimate. Sponsors
can view this "development aid" as a kind of license fee, except all
other users will benefit from new features as well. Contact information
is <a href="BION.about.html">listed here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Below are the improvements we have in mind so far. Be welcome to add 
and/or prioritize. 
</p>
<h3>Functional improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
More precise taxonomy mapping. Only similarity ratios are now used,
yet there are certain sequence positions that are specific for certain
sub-groups within larger groups. For example, it has been verified by
<p>
<a href="http://jcm.asm.org/content/50/6/1968.short">Scholz, Poulsen and Kilian, 2012</a>
</p>
that a C at a certain position will uniquely identify Streptococcus
pneumoniae within the Streptococcus genus. We also know from previous
work that preserved motifs ("signatures") are good markers at any 
level. Taking advantage of this should greatly improve accuracy and  
not hurt run-time too much. No package does this at present. 
</li>
<li>
Proper handling of sequences that are more similar to each other
than to anything in the database. Clusters of such sequences could be
visible in the existing tables as taxonomic units with generated 
names, in addition to the database taxonomic units with annotated 
names. If the databases included all species and strains that would
not be needed, but until then it is often interesting to see unknown
species and how they vary across samples. Users should not need to 
do anything, except maybe switch on a setting in the recipe, if 
even that. Qiime and Mothur can do this, but with more work by the
user. 
</li>
<li>
Taxonomic map enhancements. Taxonomy maps should link to the
sequences, so users can click and get the data for any taxonomic 
group. They should show degrees of unique placement and strength of 
similarities. Taxonomy maps should support sample groups. 
</li>
<li> 
Include popular post-analysis tools, particular statistics. If
something is missing, or proprietary-only, create it. Until then,
write BIOM format, which can be imported into Qiime and other tools.
</li>
<li>
Add top quality figures, histograms etc, using the 
<a href="http://d3js.org">D3 javascript library</a>. Figures should 
be dynamic and elegant, and act as web-presentations yet be printable
directly publishable. State-of-the-art is certainly not hard to 
improve. 
</li>
<li>
Embed method description next to the results, so readers knows how
all results were made. They should have text for articles and only
need support if there is data trouble.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mechanical improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Job queue. Be table to submit many jobs and follow progress.
</li>
<li>
Notifications. E-mail/sms notifications of job completion and
errors. The phone should ring at home if something goes wrong.
</li>
<li>
Client-pull software updates. Users should be able to list what 
new software there is, and the caveats, and then upgrade in one 
simple command. 
</li>
<li>
Documentation. Online and print from same source. Quick sheets,
template recipes and how-to's.
</li>
<li>
Control interface. First, log onto command line through the web browser
with the <a href="http://www.liftoffsoftware.com">Gate one</a> package.
Later, perhaps a web-control interface.
<li>
Publication and public home page for the software and its data.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Obvious future directions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expand to other molecules.</li>
<li>Support whole transcriptomes.</li>
<li>Motif based dna diagnostics.</li>
<li>Support genomic shutgun fragments.</li>
</ul>
